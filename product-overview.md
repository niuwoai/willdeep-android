## Security update

- Require HTTPS/WSS for network gateways, disable redirects, and permit cleartext only on literal on-device loopback. Existing HTTP pairings require secure re-pairing; credentials are retained during upgrades.
- Remove raw gateway and push-payload error logging. Disable cloud backup and device-transfer extraction for all application data domains.
- Security evidence and authorization boundaries: [docs/SECURITY_REVIEW.md](docs/SECURITY_REVIEW.md).

## Public Android download

- Download the stable signed APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xurenlu/willdeep-android/releases/latest). Requires Android 13 or later.
- Allow installation from the browser when Android prompts, then scan the current pairing QR code in WillDeep on Mac or the WillDeep CLI.
- Release procedure and signing-key backup requirements: [docs/ANDROID_RELEASE.md](docs/ANDROID_RELEASE.md).

## Project Summary

WillDeep Android is the native mobile companion for the WillDeep Mac desktop app. The phone connects to the computer through a secure relay or a trusted HTTPS gateway, displays Agent session state, and sends control commands. The Mac remains responsible for all Agent execution and safety decisions.

## Core Features

- Identify paired computers with Windows, Linux penguin, or macOS Apple icons matching their saved system labels; unspecified systems retain the generic computer icon across home, picker, and diagnostics.
- Keep conversation text visible while typing by collapsing approvals and queued-message controls into a compact entry that dismisses the keyboard to restore the review dock.

- Read Agent responses at 17sp with 27sp line height, distinct Markdown headings and spaced lists, and horizontally scrollable code blocks. Conversation tabs use a compact segmented control; approvals use consistent primary/secondary buttons and neutral surfaces. The composer keeps its familiar toolbar while reducing empty input space.

- Edit each paired computer's local alias and system label (macOS, Linux, Windows, or unspecified) from the computer picker, even while offline. Labels persist across reconnection and rescanning the same pairing; the original name and a stable short identifier remain visible. New CLI QR codes report the system through an explicit name prefix; legacy QR codes require a manual system label.

- Pair with the Mac Mobile Gateway by scanning a short H5 QR URL such as `?r=<room>&t=<token>`, scanning the legacy JSON payload, or receiving a matching `willdeep://mobile/pair?...` deep link from the H5 page.
- Accept HTTPS LAN/Tailscale fallback endpoints from `fallback_base_urls` or `base_url#tailscale=100.x.x.x` QR hints.
- Show localized invalid-payload errors for malformed QR content or missing required pairing fields.
- Require pairing payload desktop name and expiry fields before sending health or claim requests.
- Reject malformed or unsupported gateway base URLs locally before sending health or claim requests.
- Reject pairing payloads missing an explicit protocol version locally before sending health or claim requests.
- Reject unsupported Mac pairing payload protocol versions locally before sending health or claim requests.
- Reject expired Mac pairing payloads locally before sending health or claim requests.
- Reject malformed Mac pairing payload expiry timestamps locally before sending health or claim requests.
- Check Mac gateway health from either a pairing payload or the saved paired Mac, then display server version plus pairing availability without blocking paired-device diagnostics when new pairing is disabled.
- Store long-lived device tokens securely on Android, migrate the legacy single-Mac credential automatically, recover safely from stale Keystore-encrypted pairing data, and switch between multiple paired remote Macs without rescanning.
- Connect to the Mac gateway over WebSocket.
- Retry Mac gateway health checks, pairing claims, and WebSocket connections against saved secure fallback endpoints when the primary endpoint is unreachable.
- Put the selected remote Mac at the top of the home hierarchy, with a bottom-sheet computer picker, per-device last-response information, and scan/remove controls.
- Browse sessions through All, Working, Needs Confirmation, and Completed filters, grouped by project when project metadata is available or by workspace for older Mac gateways, with the newest three sessions shown by default and per-group expansion for older sessions.
- Switch between all sessions and a single project/workspace from the compact scope control above the filters.
- Keep the mobile app portrait-only and lead the home hierarchy with remote Mac status instead of a decorative page title.
- Surface the Ask WillDeep composer and queued requests directly after pairing so sending Mac Agent tasks is the primary mobile flow.
- Use the mobile composer icon toolbar, attachment entry, top-aligned input, and send button. While the Agent responds, sending adds text and images to the current session queue without stopping the current turn; empty drafts disable the button. Bottom-sheet pickers select approval mode, provider, model, skills, experts, and plugins.
- Render pending tool and patch confirmations directly inside their owning home-session card as well as in the session composer, while leaving changed-file details on the desktop.
- Collect approvals, typed questions, patch reviews, and failed phone commands in a dedicated attention center without removing inline approval controls from their owning home session.
- Provide connection diagnostics for the selected remote Mac, including truthful Mac App response state, measured gateway latency, LAN/Tailscale route classification, multi-Mac switching, the five-second/twenty-second recovery policy, and redacted sharing.
- Split session detail into Conversation, Actions, and Changes tabs while preserving the full composer on the Conversation tab.
- Accept shared plain text from other Android apps, combining shared subject/title and body/URL content before loading it into Ask WillDeep for forwarding to the Mac.
- Import highlighted Android text actions directly into Ask WillDeep for forwarding selected requirements or code snippets to the Mac.
- Automatically resume the Mac gateway connection on app start and foreground return for paired devices.
- Reconnect temporary WebSocket disconnects with bounded backoff and require pairing again when the Mac rejects a revoked token.
- Preserve unsent task text and pending action cards when the WebSocket is unavailable.
- Treat WebSocket/relay connectivity as transport only, mark a Mac online only after a real Mac App event, poll every five seconds, and wait twenty seconds before showing the Mac reconnecting state.
- Explain the relay's stale-token isolation when the server channel is connected but the Mac stays silent, and provide a direct action to scan the Mac's current pairing QR code again.
- Notify the Android user when the Mac needs attention for tool approval, patch review, typed confirmation, or `ask_user` input.
- Let safe approval and patch notifications send direct approve/reject decisions, while requests that need typed input open the matching session for continued conversation.
- Request Android 13+ notification permission and use a high-priority WillDeep attention notification channel.
- Integrate Umeng U-Push as the first real remote-push provider, gated by `UMENG_PUSH_ENABLED`, `UMENG_APPKEY`, and `UMENG_MESSAGE_SECRET` so builds stay safe before credentials and privacy consent are ready.
- Store the Umeng device token locally and optionally register it with the Mac gateway through `push.register` for later server-side attention push delivery.
- Convert Umeng custom attention payloads into the existing Android review/input notification flow.
- Show recent mobile command status so the user can see whether the Mac gateway accepted or rejected a request.
- Send phone-originated coding requests with an optional Mac workspace path in live acceptance so WillDeep edits the intended desktop repository, omitting any stale selected session id when the workspace path is supplied.
- Use localized English and Simplified Chinese UI resources.
- Display gateway status, paired desktop name, protocol version, sessions, selected session, and recent event log.
- Display recent Mac-side conversation messages with lightweight Markdown support for fenced code blocks, bullet and ordered lists, images, and simple tables, follow streaming assistant deltas, and auto-scroll session details to the bottom of the chat.
- Hide the internal vision-model description that the Mac app may append to a user message for non-vision Agent providers, keeping that model-only context out of the visible Android conversation.
- Label hidden assistant thinking, tool activity, and waiting-for-visible-output messages clearly when a raw payload exists, and hide fully empty message rows.
- Show when the Mac is still streaming an assistant response and clear the indicator on `message.done`.
- Track Mac-side changed-file activity for acceptance evidence without rendering changed-file review cards on Android.
- Send `session.list`, `session.create`, `session.select`, `message.send`, and `turn.stop` commands.
- Attach selected mobile run context (`approval_mode`, `provider_id`, `model`, `skills`, `experts`, and `plugins`) to `message.send` payloads for Mac-side handling.
- Restore pending tool and patch approvals from the initial Mac snapshot, then send `tool.decide` or `patch.decide` back to the Mac.
- Require typed `confirm` input before approving danger-tier Mac tool calls that include `requires_confirmation`.
- During strict live acceptance, automatically approve pending Mac tools only when they require neither an answer nor typed confirmation, preserving the existing safety gates.
- During strict live acceptance, run only the live Mac gateway instrumentation test when a live payload is present, preserve partial ack/activity markers, and record host-side target-file changes as fallback evidence when Android receives code activity but misses the exact target-file event.
- Remove completed Mac tool approvals from the approval panel when `tool.updated` reports a non-pending state.
- Remove completed Mac patch proposals from the approval panel when `patch.upsert` reports a non-pending state.
- Answer Mac-side `ask_user` prompts from the Android approval panel.
- Approve or reject pending patch proposals from Android while leaving detailed diff review on the desktop.
- Display Mac background jobs and kill running jobs through the gateway.
- Read text files from the selected Mac session workspace through desktop-mediated `file.read`.
- Display queued Mac requests and control the selected session queue through `queue.update`.

## Run

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

Install a debug APK only on a dedicated test device. For the release build, use scripts/security_device_check.rb after a signed in-place installation; it does not uninstall or clear the user application. Historical live smoke commands below require a trusted HTTPS gateway or an explicitly configured on-device loopback route.

The JVM client integration test covers the real `MobileGatewayClient` against a local mock gateway. The instrumented Compose smoke test drives pairing, WebSocket connection, initial snapshot display, `message.send`, streamed assistant text, danger-tier `tool.pending` typed confirmation, `tool.decide`, `patch.upsert`, `diff.get`, and `patch.decide` against an in-process gateway mock. The connected-device smoke runner writes `build/android_connected_smoke/report.json` and `build/android_connected_smoke/report.md`, records a skipped report when no Android device is attached, can fetch a fresh desktop-authenticated pairing payload by preferring `POST /mobile/pairing/rotate` and falling back to legacy `GET /mobile/pairing` only for older Mac gateways, validates live pairing payload JSON, required fields, protocol version, an HTTP/HTTPS `base_url` with a host, and a strict ISO8601 expiry timestamp, then checks the Mac gateway `/mobile/health` endpoint for host-side reachability and pairing availability before passing the payload to instrumentation. When no live payload or desktop gateway variables are provided, it can auto-discover WillDeep's default runtime desktop-token file under macOS Application Support and use `http://127.0.0.1:8877` for desktop-authenticated pairing rotation; if a device is attached but no live payload is available, normal smoke records skipped connected-instrumentation steps instead of running a guaranteed-failing device test. Mac gateway HTTP preflights use direct connections so local proxy environment variables cannot divert LAN requests. When devices are attached and a live payload is available, it captures IPv4-redacted Android network diagnostics, checks Android device-side gateway reachability through `adb shell`, clears live smoke logcat markers, filters connected instrumentation to the live Mac gateway test, and collects `WillDeepLiveSmoke` markers after instrumentation. It can pass a fresh Mac pairing payload to a live-gateway instrumentation test through either `MOBILE_GATEWAY_PAIRING_PAYLOAD`, explicit `MOBILE_GATEWAY_DESKTOP_BASE_URL` plus `MOBILE_GATEWAY_DESKTOP_TOKEN`/`MOBILE_GATEWAY_DESKTOP_TOKEN_FILE`, or the default runtime token-file auto-discovery path; reports identify whether the payload came from `env`, `desktop-rotate`, `desktop-get`, or `none`, whether auto-discovery was used, next actions for missing payloads/devices/live messages/activity checks, and `acceptance_evidence` rows for the live payload, Mac health preflight, Android device, device reachability, live instrumentation, `message.send` acknowledgement, post-send Mac Agent activity, post-send Mac code activity, and the requested target file. When `MOBILE_GATEWAY_LIVE_MESSAGE` is also set, the live instrumentation sends a real `message.send` command, waits for Mac acknowledgement, and emits an acknowledgement marker. When `MOBILE_GATEWAY_EXPECT_AGENT_ACTIVITY=1` is also set, it waits for Mac-side Agent activity after the send and does not count a mobile user-message echo as activity; accepted evidence is responding state, assistant output, tool/patch/job updates, or worktree changes. When `MOBILE_GATEWAY_EXPECT_CODE_ACTIVITY=1` is also set, it waits for a stricter code/workspace signal: pending tool, patch proposal, live job, or worktree file change. When `MOBILE_GATEWAY_EXPECTED_TARGET_FILE` is set, it also waits until that path appears in Mac patch or worktree activity, and the host runner records a `host_target_file` fallback when the requested Mac workspace file changes after the Android-originated command. `REQUIRE_MOBILE_GATEWAY_LIVE_ACCEPTANCE=1` turns the runner into the final acceptance gate: it exits non-zero unless live payload, health, Android device, device reachability, live instrumentation, message ack, accepted ack marker, enabled Agent activity check with a concrete Mac activity signal, enabled code activity check with a concrete Mac code signal, configured target file, and target-file signal or host target-file change all pass. `scripts/mobile_gateway_live_acceptance.rb` wraps that final gate into one command, supplies a default workspace-edit request targeting `WILLDEEP_ANDROID_LIVE_ACCEPTANCE.md` with a unique run marker, writes `build/mobile_gateway_live_acceptance/report.json` and `report.md`, mirrors the strict smoke failures for handoff, records Android version, payload source, non-secret request profile, target filename, attached device count, ack/activity/code-activity/target-file markers, host target-file marker, SHA256 hashes for the underlying smoke reports, and adds a Mac Gateway preflight section for default token-file presence plus public health reachability/version/protocol/pairing metadata. Pairing payloads, bearer tokens, and live messages are redacted from reports. The Ruby gateway integration script writes `build/mobile_gateway_mock_integration/report.json` and `build/mobile_gateway_mock_integration/report.md`, verifies that `ack` and `error` envelope IDs correlate with the originating mobile command IDs, and checks that snapshots include pending tools plus patch proposals.

## Known Gaps

- Live Mac gateway testing still requires an attached Android device plus a fresh two-minute Mac pairing payload at run time.
- Project grouping falls back to workspace grouping until the connected Mac gateway includes `project_id` and `project_name` in session/workspace payloads.
- Additional locales beyond English and Simplified Chinese are pending.
